title: Where are the Lee's?

*[Google killed this API feature in 2013 so the site no longer exists]*

[wherearethelees.com](http://www.wherearethelees.com/) was a creation for Mother's Day between [Ted](http://www.twitter.com/tedlee/) and I. So where did the idea come from?

Harry Potter, of course. The Weasley's had a clock ([Whereabouts Clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Weasley_family_clock)) that told them where everyone in the family was at all times.

Short of being magical, we created this because my Mom doesn't yet own a cell phone.

Right now it's a mash-up of [Google's Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and [Twitter's API](https://dev.twitter.com).

A "DINNER!" button that allows my Mom to press a button that sends a text to all our phones may be in the pipes for the near future.
