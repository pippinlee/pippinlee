title: Where are the Lee's?
---

[wherearethelees.com](http://www.wherearethelees.com/) was a creation for Mother's Day between [Ted](http://www.twitter.com/tedlee/) and I. So where did the idea come from?

Harry Potter, of course. The weasley's had a clock.

Short of being magicla, we created this because my mom doesn't yet own a cell phone.

                Harry Potter, of course. The Weasley's had a clock (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Weasley_family_clock" target="_blank">Whereabouts Clock</a>) that told them where everyone in the family was at all times. <br /><br />

                Short of being magical, we created this because my Mom doesn't yet own a cell phone. <br /><br />

                Right now it's a mash-up of <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/" target="_blank">Google's Map API</a> and <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter's API</a>.<br /><br />

                A "DINNER!" button that allows my Mom to press a button that sends a text to all our phones may be in the pipes for the near future.
