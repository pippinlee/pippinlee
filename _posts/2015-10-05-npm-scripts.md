title: How to convert your Gruntfile to npm scripts

---

In this post we're going to take a quick look at npm scripts, and the thought process behind writing them. We'll do this by taking [Mozilla's Makerstrap project](https://github.com/mozilla/makerstrap) and its [Gruntfile](https://github.com/mozilla/makerstrap/blob/master/package.json) and convert it to npm scripts to show us the benefits of npm scripts as a frontend build tool.

**I should note before starting that there are many use cases for Grunt or Gulp, and npm scripts may not cover all of them. While it's likely npm scripts can reduce your Grunt or Gulp files greatly, this post's goal isn't to diminish the usefulness of those task running services.**

**The goal of this post is to introduce another way that arguably has some simplification benefits. I ‚ù§Ô∏è what Gulp and Grunt have done for frontend workflows---npm scripts is simply another option that we should consider.**

## Quick overview

If you already have a good understanding of npm scripts you can skip this overview.

If you're less confident with [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), all you really need to know is that it allows you to add tasks to your package.json's `scripts` object. These tasks are run pretty much exactly like how you would run them through the command line.

What does a npm script look like? `start: node server.js` is a example of a simple script that allows a node server to start when you type `npm start`.

There are 3 main things you should know about npm script naming:

#### 1) built-in script naming

npm has a list of ready-to-use npm script property names such as `start`, `run`, and `test`. In fact the command you likely use daily, `npm install`, is an npm script! You can run a script by running `$ npm <name of script>`.

#### 2) pre and post script naming

When naming your scripts, you can add `pre` or `post` to tell npm to run them before or after. So if you have a `start` script, you could also write a `prestart` script that will run something before the `start` script runs.


#### 3) custom script naming

If you're like me, and want to be more üê†expressiveüê†, you can use your own script names. If for example we wanted to re-write that start command we could do so with `getTheFluxCapacitorFluxingDoc: node server.js`.

To run our custom named script we'd then run `$ npm run getTheFluxCapacitorFluxingDoc`, with `run` telling npm to run a non-standard named script.

**Running multiple scripts**

To run multiple scripts we can use syntax like `npm run watch:*` which looks for any `watch:<asubtask>` and runs them. This allows us to break use a script strucutre that represent smaller individual tasks, and then run them altogether.

Another popular way of running scripts is with [`npm-run-all`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all) module which allows us to use its `--parallel` argument to run scripts in parallel.

Just like on the command line, npm scripts also allows us to use `&&` syntax to add additional commands to a script.


**TLDR: Why do I use npm scripts?**

* if you're already using npm, you don't need to install anything. No extra task runner to install
* no added abstraction of learning the ins and outs of Gulp and Grunt (that isn't to say there aren't some benefits to their abstraction too)
* in my experience the code and time spent writing npm scripts is considerably less!
* no more plugins

## Let's begin

We're going to work through converting Makerstrap's Gruntfile into npm scripts that will live in `package.json`. This should hopefully show that simplifying your build process isn't too painful. Let's take quick look at the Gruntfile:

{% highlight javascript %}
module.exports = function(grunt) {
  require('time-grunt')(grunt);
  require('jit-grunt')(grunt, {
    shell: 'grunt-shell-spawn'
  });

  grunt.initConfig({
    pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),
    less: {
      development: {
        files: {
          'demo/compiled/demo.dev.css': 'demo/less/demo.less'
        },
        options: {
          sourceMap: true
        }
      },
      build: {
        files: {
          'dist/makerstrap.min.css': 'less/build/makerstrap.less',
          'dist/makerstrap.complete.min.css':
          'less/build/makerstrap.complete.less',
          'demo/compiled/demo.css': 'demo/less/demo.less'
        },
        options: {
          compress: true
        }
      }
    },
    shell: {
      runServer: {
        options: {
          async: true
        },
        command: 'node demo/server.js'
      }
    },
    watch: {
      less: {
        files: ['less/**/*.less', 'demo/less/**/*.less'],
        tasks: ['less:development'],
        options: {
          spawn: false
        }
      }
    },
    copy: {
      latest: {
        expand: true,
        cwd: 'dist/',
        src: '**/*',
        dest: 'deploy/latest/'
      },
      version: {
        expand: true,
        cwd: 'dist/',
        src: '**/*',
        dest: 'deploy/v<%= pkg.version %>/'
      }
    },
    filesize: {
      base: {
        files: [
          {
            expand: true,
            cwd: 'dist/',
            src: ['*.css']
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  });

  grunt.registerTask('default', ['less:development', 'shell:runServer',
  'watch' ]);
  grunt.registerTask('stats', ['less:development', 'filesize']);
  grunt.registerTask('build', ['less:build', 'filesize']);
  grunt.registerTask('deploy', ['copy']);
};
{% endhighlight %}

### So what's under there anyways? Under wear?

To start our process of writing npm scripts, let's start by breaking the Gruntfile into it's different pieces. There are 4 registered tasks at the bottom of the Gruntfile:

1. default (works with just running `grunt`)
2. stats
3. build
4. deploy

We'll use this structure for writing our npm scripts.

## 1) `default` task

These tasks would be typically run by running `grunt`, and were used as a way to get the necessary server and files going for development. The task is made up of three pieces that are wrapped together in a `registerTask` called `default`.

`grunt.registerTask('default', ['less:development', 'shell:runServer', 'watch' ]);`

#### a) `less:development`

Let's first look at trying to rewrite the `less:development` part of the task as an npm script.

{% highlight javascript %}
less: {
  development: {
    files: {
      'demo/compiled/demo.dev.css': 'demo/less/demo.less'
    },
    options: {
      sourceMap: true
    }
  },
},
{% endhighlight %}

In the Gruntfile we used `'demo/compiled/demo.dev.css': 'demo/less/demo.less'` to compile `demo.less` to `demo.dev.css` and place it in a `compiled` directory.

We can use the great [autoless](https://github.com/jgonera/autoless) module to help us compile our `.less` file. While autoless does have a `watch` feature we don't need that here because we just want the compile feature.

`autoless` doesn't let's you specify a specific file, so we can just give it the `demo/less/` directory as a source, and `demo/compiled/` as the output point for the compiled `.css` file.

Here's what the above Gruntfile code looks like as an npm script:

{% highlight javascript %}
"less-dev": "autoless --source-map --no-watch demo/less/ demo/compiled/"
{% endhighlight %}


#### b) `watch`

Our next ~task~ to recreate as a script is a watch task:

{% highlight javascript %}
watch: {
  less: {
    files: ['less/**/*.less', 'demo/less/**/*.less'],
    tasks: ['less:development'],
    options: {
      spawn: false
    }
  }
},
{% endhighlight %}

The above code watches a set of `.less` files and runs the `less:development` compile task when it sees a change.

We can use `autoless` here again. We'll also give it the general directory name:

{% highlight javascript %}
"watch:demo": "autoless --source-map demo/less/ && npm run less-dev",
"watch:base": "autoless --source-map less/ && npm run less-dev"
{% endhighlight %}


#### c) `shell:runServer`

Finally, we need to look at adding a short script to replace this command.

{% highlight javascript %}
shell: {
  runServer: {
    options: {
      async: true
    },
    command: 'node demo/server.js'
  }
},
{% endhighlight %}

This Grunt task can be summed up very nicely like so:

`"server": "node demo/server.js"`

Note: `server` is one of npm's reserved properties.


## 2) `stats` task


For the stats task we'll need to write a script that checks the filesize. We already have the `less:dev` task completed above.

`grunt.registerTask('stats', ['less:development', 'filesize']);`


#### a) `filesize`

{% highlight javascript %}
filesize: {
  base: {
    files: [
      {
        expand: true,
        cwd: 'dist/',
        src: ['*.css']
      }
    ]
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The above code outputs the following when `$ grunt stats` is run:

![grunt task](https://cldup.com/I4qr6-GSHp.png)

It returns the size `makerstrap.complete.min.css` and `makerstrap.min.css`, it also tells us how long it took for the task to run.

For the purpose of this post, we'll skip trying to output nice charts, and focus just on returning the file sizes.

I couldn't find an alternative to the Grunt filesize plugin, but it's a very simple feature to recreate. Just create a tiny `filesize.js` module and use `fs.stat` to return the filesize values.

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');
var path = process.argv[2];
var cli = require('cli-color');

fs.stat(path, function(error, stats) {
  console.log(path + ': ' + cli.green(Math.floor(stats.size/1024) + 'kb'));
});
{% endhighlight %}

Because npm scripts allows us to run a node command from the script, we can use `filesize.js` like so to return the filesizes:

`stats: node filesize.js makerstrap.complete.min.js && node filesize.js makerstrap.min.js`

which outputs something very similar to the grunt plug-in.
![](https://cldup.com/BKWn1bE3wu.png)

## 3) `build` task

We've already written a `filesize` script, so we'll just focus on `less:build`.

`grunt.registerTask('build', ['less:build', 'filesize']);`

#### a) `less:build`

{% highlight javascript %}
build: {
  files: {
    'dist/makerstrap.min.css': 'less/build/makerstrap.less',
    'dist/makerstrap.complete.min.css': 'less/build/makerstrap.complete.less',
      'demo/compiled/demo.css': 'demo/less/demo.less'
  },
  options: {
    compress: true
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The above code builds our Makerstrap app readying it for deployment.

It creates `dist/makerstrap.min.css`, `dist/makerstrap.complete.min.css`, and `demo/compiled/demo.css` from their respective `.less` files.

* less/build/makerstrap.less -> dist/makerstrap.min.css
* less/build/makerstrap.complete.less -> dist/makerstrap.complete.min.css
* demo/less/demo.less -> demo/compiled/demo.css

To accomplish this, we can re-use our `less-dev` task and combine it with another `autoless` command to handle the two `build/` files. Altogether our npm script for the build task would look something like this:

`npm run less-dev && autoless --source-map --no-watch less/build/ dist/`


## 4) `deploy`

Now, we can write the script for the final Grunt task:

`grunt.registerTask('deploy', ['copy']);`

#### a) `copy`

{% highlight javascript %}
copy: {
  latest: {
    expand: true,
    cwd: 'dist/',
    src: '**/*',
    dest: 'deploy/latest/'
  },
  version: {
    expand: true,
    cwd: 'dist/',
    src: '**/*',
    dest: 'deploy/v<%= pkg.version %>/'
  }
},
{% endhighlight %}


`copy:latest` creates a directory called `latest` in `/dist` and adds a build version of your app.


`copy:version` creates a directory called `version` in `/dist` and adds a build version of Makerstrap's css files.

We can use the great [`cpx module`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cpx) to copy files to `/dist` like so:

{% highlight javascript %}
"build:deploy": "npm run build:copy && build:version",
"build:copy": "cpx \"**/*\" deploy/latest/",
"build:version": "cpx \"dist/**/*\" deploy/pkg-version/",
{% endhighlight %}



## Wrap up

So if we take all of our newly written npm scripts, we should have something that looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
"scripts": {
  "start": "npm-run-all --parallel server watch:*",
  "less-dev": "autoless --source-map --no-watch demo/less/ demo/compiled/",
  "watch:demo": "autoless --source-map demo/less/ && npm run less-dev",
  "watch:base": "autoless --source-map less/ && npm run less-dev",
  "build": "npm run less-dev && autoless --source-map --no-watch less/build dist/",
  "build:deploy": "npm run build:copy && build:version",
  "build:copy": "cpx \"**/*\" deploy/latest/",
  "build:version": "cpx \"dist/**/*\" deploy/pkg-version/",
  "server": "node demo/server.js",
  "postinstall": "bower install"
}
{% endhighlight %}

For ease I've used the [`npm-run-all`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all) module to be able to run the server and watch tasks in parallel when I run `npm start`.

All told, that wasn't too painless, and should hopefully be easier to handle as your app and frontend pieces evolve.
