        <p>In this post we’re going to take a quick look at npm scripts, and the thought process behind writing them. We’ll do this by taking <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/makerstrap">Mozilla’s Makerstrap project</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/makerstrap/blob/master/package.json">Gruntfile</a> and convert it to npm scripts to show us the benefits of npm scripts as a frontend build tool.</p> <p><strong>I should note before starting that there are many use cases for Grunt or Gulp, and npm scripts may not cover all of them. While it’s likely npm scripts can reduce your Grunt or Gulp files greatly, this post’s goal isn’t to diminish the usefulness of those task running services.</strong></p> <p><strong>The goal of this post is to introduce another way that arguably has some simplification benefits. I ❤️ what Gulp and Grunt have done for frontend workflows—npm scripts is simply another option that we should consider.</strong></p> <h2 id="quick-overview">Quick overview</h2> <p>If you already have a good understanding of npm scripts you can skip this overview.</p> <p>If you’re less confident with <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts">npm scripts</a>, all you really need to know is that it allows you to add tasks to your...

We were able to talk to students quite literally scattered across the globe, from Pakistan and India, to small-town USA, and big cities in Europe. These were students that shared our frustration with the lack of opportunities at their universities to tinker at the intersection of code and journalism.</p> <p>While we’ve written, talked, and advised students newsrooms — <strong>we’ve been lacking in our methodology</strong>. At best we’re able to recommend similar setups we’ve seen at professional newsrooms. We haven’t been able to clearly point to what has (and hasn’t) worked. We can’t share how we got a student newsroom curious about programming or obsessing over data. In part this is because nothing like this exists in Canada — we’re carving out a new and important path in journalism education. Today we’re announcing...

If we want to share a bit of information, whether that be an emotion, or description — we can create a new collection of letters to form a new word. As long as another person has a common understanding of this combination of letters, we can now use our new word in <a href="http://number27.org/wb-language">sharing information from one mind to another</a>. Languages can be pretty neat this way, and can get even more descriptive if we talk about emojis.</p> <p>Software, on the other hand, has overhead and accessibility issues. Sure, it also allows you to invent new meanings, and even create new languages — but currently it only evolves when you tell the machine to do something specific, and with correct details. This makes it tough for most to get involved and interested in seeing how the web, and computers will shape publishing going forward.</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/maxbittker">Max Bittker</a> and I were lucky enough to spend the last weekend in June on...

        <p><img src="https://cldup.com/3NY1WV6NAH.png" alt="" /></p> <p>How do principles become timeless?</p> <p>When I discovered Strunk and White’s (1920) famous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Elements-Style-Fourth-Edition/dp/020530902X">The Element of Style</a> in school, it provided one of the best lessons in brevity I’ve experienced. I still keep it in mind whenever I’m asked to write, because its concise points are timeless––timeless in the sense that while it is about style, it is not binded to style. Strunk and White’s style guide is still incredibly in-touch with writers almost 100 years later.</p> <p>So I was happy to find this book, a derivative of the famous Strunk and White book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Elements-Programming-Style-Edition/dp/0070342075">The Elements of Programming Style</a> by Kernighan and Plauger, written in 1978, close to 40 years ago.</p> <p>TEPS uses Fortran as its example language, but much like the book that inspired it, the lessons it teaches are timeless and still hold up today. When you can distill rule and opinion to good practice, you can advice that lasts a longtime.</p> <p><strong>I don’t think it’s quite right to call either the English, or programming style guide timeless, but it’s still evidence...
